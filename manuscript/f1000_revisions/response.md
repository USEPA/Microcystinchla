## Additional discussion needed in methods related to the National Lakes Assessment:
The readership may not be aware of the U.S. NLA performed in 2007. The author(s) should clarify where samples were collected (nearshore or from the surface in the deeper waters). NLA chlorophyll a samples were take from the profundal zone rather than the littoral zone. The readership may also be interested in how many chl a samples were collected from each lake. Where were the microcystin-LR samples collected?
    - **Response:**  

## Additional discussion needed on how the data were organized for data analysis:
Were these samples paired (collected at the same time from the same locale) or are these some type of aggregated value over a lake season? Describing this in the methods will really help for understanding the importance of this work. Paired results (MC-LR and Chl a from the same day) are much more impactful for demonstrating the rapid advantage of chl a compated to using results that are a seasonal average indicating that the hypereutrophic and eutrophic lakes (ones with the highest chl a) are also the ones that are most likely to have a cyanoHAB event sometime during the year.
    - **Response:**  
 
## Improved discussion needed on alternative indicators for cHABs and cyanotoxins not assessed in the NLA: 
Brief mention is given to phycocyanin (one study), and the additional language (about phycocyanin not always being available for measure and when measured, it is for only measuring pigment and not toxins) is equally relevant for chl a. The same in vivo handheld fluorometers and continuous monitoring solutions available for chl a are now widely available for phycocyanin, often at the same cost as a rapid measure for chl a. Phycocyanin, like chl a, does not measure toxin either, but phycocyanin in many studies has outperformed chl a, and in some studies it has not (especially when toxin concentration is low). Historical records on PC are likely not as great as chlorophyll a. Overall, several studies on this topic have been produced in the last two to four years (see Zamyadi and Dorner’s work), with one study using phycocyanin to predict non-alcoholic liver disease presuming a relationship with cyanotoxins (Zhang et al. 2015)
    - **Response:**  
 
## Consideration desired on region-specific criteria or limitations of national recommendations for chl a: 
With nearly 30% of the lakes in the temperate plains being coded as poor for chlorophyll a in the 2007 NLA, what impact would these conditional probabilities have on these lakes? Should the lake managers in this region be monitoring continuously all the time? What are the mean/median chlorophyll a  levels for this part of the U.S? Regional variability may be really important and did the conditional probability approach take this into consideration or can it take it into consideration? Is there a way to evaluate if there are significant regional effects in the U.S? For nutrient standards in the U.S. and macroinvertebrate assessments, EPA has had to issue region-specific guidelines/criteria, etc. for some parameters.
    - **Response:**  
 
## Greater discussion needed on limitations of NLA and need for model validation/future studies: 
The paper fails to address the limitations of the NLA – as a reader, I’m not aware of the limitations. I have much respect for the NLA, but I do have questions regarding the number of samples for each lake. Furthermore, a statement or two discussing the need to validate modeled data may be worthwhile. Is there a way to see if the probabilities actually align with the accuracy and type II error rates predicted by the conditional probability approach?

### Abstract-Specific Comments: 
- Near the bottom of the abstract, the units seem quite high for microcystins (g/L) rather than micrograms/L. The micro Greek symbol (mu) may have been lost during uploading.
    - **Response:**  
  
### Results Comments: 
- In discussing the lake exceedances of the various recommended levels by EPA, the addition of ‘drinking water’ is appropriate in my opinion. Although it is mentioned earlier in the methods, further providing the information in the results is helpful to a novice reader or a person just becoming familiar with drinking water regulations and guidelines, as the U.S. EPA child level may be presumed by a reader to be a level for recreation in a lake rather than a level associated with finished drinking water after water treatment. 
    - **Response:**  
 
- “All lakes had reported chl a concentrations that exceeded detection limits” Does this mean that some were over range? Or  does this mean that “All lakes had detectable levels of chl a”
    - **Response:**  
  
### Discussion Comments: 
- The wedge pattern in figure 2 is not apparent in figure 2, however, the logic makes sense and is supported visually by the conditional probability plots in fig 1. If figure 2 could have two lines of best fit (similar to the way some researchers do for funnel plots on publication bias papers), it may be easier to see the wedge shape.

## I think the authors need to more broadly consider the existing literature and describe how their findings relate to and build from past studies. Below, I provide some related studies that the authors might want to consider. 
    - **Response:**  
 
## Based on the 2007 National Lakes Assessment report, roughly two-thirds of the waterbodies reported no detectable microcystin (detection limit = 0.05 ug/L) despite covering a huge range of chlorophyll concentrations.  And, Fig 2 suggests that a large number of sites had barely detectable concentration of microcystin across a wide range of chlorophyll.  It is not clear from the text how the authors dealt with waterbodies with undetectable or barely detectable microcystin concentrations.
    - **Response:**  
 
## Presenting histograms of chlorophyll and microcystin concentrations for the study lakes would be useful. 
    - **Response:**  
 
## I am not an expert on conditional probability analysis. Based on the authors’ text (second paragraph in Analytical Methods section), it appears that this analysis considers multiple events over time. If their dataset includes single measurements in a waterbody, I don’t understand where the temporal component comes into the analysis. Again, I could be totally misunderstanding how this analysis works and should probably read the relevant references the authors provided. 
    - **Response:**  

## Based on increasing error in the conditional probability plots as chlorophyll increases, the reported chlorophyll thresholds should not include significant digits (i.e., ± 0.1) but instead be whole numbers.
    - **Response:**  

## I would organize the information in table 1 by either concentration (low to high) or advisory type (drinking or recreational) and concentration (low to high). It might also be useful to include the number of lakes represented in each category based on microcystin. 
    - **Response:**  

## In table 2, I would add the specific microcystin concentration target under each advisory type to avoid having to look back at table 1 for these data.
    - **Response:**  

## Most waterbodies lacked microcystin and Figure 2 clearly shows that there are a huge number of waterbodies across a large chlorophyll range that apparently had microcystin concentrations at the detection limit of 0.05 ug/L. I am concerned about the microcystin data at the detection limit. They appear to be false positives. I agree with the authors who acknowledged that high chlorophyll is not always a good predictor of high microcystin. What should be done for those waterbodies with high concentrations of chlorophyll but that had no or barely detectable microcystin?
    - **Response:**  

## I am confused about the data collected and available for the 2007 National Lakes Assessment. For example, I organized this dataset in July 2010 and found that 1158 lakes were sampled once (1152 of these lakes included data for both chlorophyll and microcystin) and 95 of the 1158 originally sampled lakes were sampled a second time in 2007. Yuan et al. 2014 (Freshwater Biology) used data for 1077 sampled lakes. The current study (as well as the National Lakes Assessment website and report) describes data for 1028 lakes. Clarity about these discrepancies is not necessarily the authors’ job, but it would be good to understand why the differences exist across these datasets. Also, for this study, how were data used for lakes sampled twice in 2007?  
    - **Response:**  

## Although all of the National Lakes Assessment data are publicly available, the authors should provide the dataset that they used for this study.

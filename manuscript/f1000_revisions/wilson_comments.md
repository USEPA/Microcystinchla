Title and Abstract: 
For clarity, the authors might consider replacing “various” with “World Health Organization and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency”.  
 
Article content: 
Using publicly available data produced from the 2007 USEPA National Lakes Assessment, the authors use conditional probability analysis to develop four chlorophyll concentration thresholds associated with two USEPA microcystin drinking water advisory targets, one WHO microcystin drinking water advisory target, and one WHO microcystin recreational use target.  For most water resource managers, chlorophyll is much easier and cheaper to measure than microcystin. Given the threat that microcystins pose to human health, the purpose of this study is valuable. With that said, this study significantly overlaps with Yuan et al. (2014).  The current study adds new advisory microcystin targets recently established by USEPA and uses a different statistical approach than Yuan et al. 2014. The authors cite relatively few studies. I think the authors need to more broadly consider the existing literature and describe how their findings relate to and build from past studies. Below, I provide some related studies that the authors might want to consider. I am certain that I have missed other relevant studies.

Based on the 2007 National Lakes Assessment report, roughly two-thirds of the waterbodies reported no detectable microcystin (detection limit = 0.05 ug/L) despite covering a huge range of chlorophyll concentrations.  And, Fig 2 suggests that a large number of sites had barely detectable concentration of microcystin across a wide range of chlorophyll.  It is not clear from the text how the authors dealt with waterbodies with undetectable or barely detectable microcystin concentrations.  
 
Presenting histograms of chlorophyll and microcystin concentrations for the study lakes would be useful. 
 
I am not an expert on conditional probability analysis. Based on the authors’ text (second paragraph in Analytical Methods section), it appears that this analysis considers multiple events over time. If their dataset includes single measurements in a waterbody, I don’t understand where the temporal component comes into the analysis. Again, I could be totally misunderstanding how this analysis works and should probably read the relevant references the authors provided. 
 
Based on increasing error in the conditional probability plots as chlorophyll increases, the reported chlorophyll thresholds should not include significant digits (i.e., ± 0.1) but instead be whole numbers.
 
I would organize the information in table 1 by either concentration (low to high) or advisory type (drinking or recreational) and concentration (low to high). It might also be useful to include the number of lakes represented in each category based on microcystin. In table 2, I would add the specific microcystin concentration target under each advisory type to avoid having to look back at table 1 for these data.
 
Conclusions: 
The purpose of this study is to use a simple measurement (chlorophyll) to determine the threat that microcystins pose to a waterbody relative to existing microcystin concentration targets. Most waterbodies lacked microcystin and Figure 2 clearly shows that there are a huge number of waterbodies across a large chlorophyll range that apparently had microcystin concentrations at the detection limit of 0.05 ug/L. I am concerned about the microcystin data at the detection limit. They appear to be false positives. I agree with the authors who acknowledged that high chlorophyll is not always a good predictor of high microcystin. What should be done for those waterbodies with high concentrations of chlorophyll but that had no or barely detectable microcystin?
 
Data: 
I am confused about the data collected and available for the 2007 National Lakes Assessment. For example, I organized this dataset in July 2010 and found that 1158 lakes were sampled once (1152 of these lakes included data for both chlorophyll and microcystin) and 95 of the 1158 originally sampled lakes were sampled a second time in 2007. Yuan et al. 2014 (Freshwater Biology) used data for 1077 sampled lakes. The current study (as well as the National Lakes Assessment website and report) describes data for 1028 lakes. Clarity about these discrepancies is not necessarily the authors’ job, but it would be good to understand why the differences exist across these datasets. Also, for this study, how were data used for lakes sampled twice in 2007?  
 
Although all of the National Lakes Assessment data are publicly available, the authors should provide the dataset that they used for this study.

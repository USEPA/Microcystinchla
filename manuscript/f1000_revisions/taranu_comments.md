General comments
This study provides an elegant framework to predict the severe impairment of U.S. lakes and reservoirs by cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. I especially appreciated the clever use of conditional probability analysis to identify chlorophyll a threshold above which MC concentrations exceed WHO drinking water and recreational provisional guidelines. Chlorophyll a is a regularly measured water quality variable, and this study indeed offers a promising approach that can me used in many lakes around the world to identify problematic lakes or regions. In that regard, it would have been interesting to account for the spatial heterogeneity across this landscape -- as indicated by Beaver et al. (2014), some regions of the continental U.S. are more likely to be MC hotspots. Accounting for this heterogeneity will likely help explain some of the noise in the biplot shown in Fig. 2. I have also analyzed the MC data from the same dataset and found that accounting for different ecoregions in my model (as presented in Beaver et al., 2014) helped further explain the probability of detecting versus failing to detect MC in lakes. I am curious to know how this would play out with your modeling approach (conditional probability analysis).

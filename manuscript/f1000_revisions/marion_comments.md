Overview: The manuscript/article addresses a critical question applicable to recreational and drinking water managers: Can we rapidly predict potentially harmful cyanobacteria blooms using traditional water quality methods? This question is likely to become more relevant according to the most current literature as blooms are expected to increase in frequency in the midst of a warming global climate facing more extreme storm and drought events 1-6. Using the rather large and nationally applicable National Lakes Assessment database for the United States, the authors demonstrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of using chlorophyll a as an indicator for at-risk conditions that could warrant management action or follow-up testing for cyanotoxins. The authors are also able to assign action levels or at least share possible action levels for management action using conditional probabilities. The strengths and weaknesses of selected probabilities are described using analyses similar to specificity and sensitivity in the form of accuracy and ‘avoiding type II errors’. The authors do not propose using chlorophyll a as a proxy to replace toxin measurement, but as a tool to help facilitate targeted monitoring of toxins during at-risk conditions.
 
Overall Comments: The article is meritorious in that it does provide a meaningful starting point for lakes with no phycocyanin measures and for providing a meaningful starting point for developing some semblance of an action level that could be employed by recreational water and drinking water managers concerned with cyanotoxins. The article does stand to improve significantly in some key areas, which are as follows:
 
(1) Additional discussion in methods related to the National Lakes Assessment
(2) Additional discussion needed on how the data were organized for data analysis
(3) Improved discussion needed on alternative indicators for cHABs and cyanotoxins not assessed in the NLA
(4) Consideration of region-specific criteria or limitations of national recommendations for chl a.
(5) Greater discussion on limitations of NLA and need for model validation/future studies.
 
(1) Additional discussion needed in methods related to the National Lakes Assessment:
The readership may not be aware of the U.S. NLA performed in 2007. The author(s) should clarify where samples were collected (nearshore or from the surface in the deeper waters). NLA chlorophyll a samples were take from the profundal zone rather than the littoral zone. The readership may also be interested in how many chl a samples were collected from each lake. Where were the microcystin-LR samples collected?
 
(2) Additional discussion needed on how the data were organized for data analysis:
Were these samples paired (collected at the same time from the same locale) or are these some type of aggregated value over a lake season? Describing this in the methods will really help for understanding the importance of this work. Paired results (MC-LR and Chl a from the same day) are much more impactful for demonstrating the rapid advantage of chl a compated to using results that are a seasonal average indicating that the hypereutrophic and eutrophic lakes (ones with the highest chl a) are also the ones that are most likely to have a cyanoHAB event sometime during the year.
 
(3) Improved discussion needed on alternative indicators for cHABs and cyanotoxins not assessed in the NLA: Brief mention is given to phycocyanin (one study), and the additional language (about phycocyanin not always being available for measure and when measured, it is for only measuring pigment and not toxins) is equally relevant for chl a. The same in vivo handheld fluorometers and continuous monitoring solutions available for chl a are now widely available for phycocyanin, often at the same cost as a rapid measure for chl a. Phycocyanin, like chl a, does not measure toxin either, but phycocyanin in many studies has outperformed chl a, and in some studies it has not (especially when toxin concentration is low). Historical records on PC are likely not as great as chlorophyll a. Overall, several studies on this topic have been produced in the last two to four years (see Zamyadi and Dorner’s work), with one study using phycocyanin to predict non-alcoholic liver disease presuming a relationship with cyanotoxins (Zhang et al. 2015)
 
(4) Consideration desired on region-specific criteria or limitations of national recommendations for chl a: With nearly 30% of the lakes in the temperate plains being coded as poor for chlorophyll a in the 2007 NLA, what impact would these conditional probabilities have on these lakes? Should the lake managers in this region be monitoring continuously all the time? What are the mean/median chlorophyll a  levels for this part of the U.S? Regional variability may be really important and did the conditional probability approach take this into consideration or can it take it into consideration? Is there a way to evaluate if there are significant regional effects in the U.S? For nutrient standards in the U.S. and macroinvertebrate assessments, EPA has had to issue region-specific guidelines/criteria, etc. for some parameters.
 
(5) Greater discussion needed on limitations of NLA and need for model validation/future studies: The paper fails to address the limitations of the NLA – as a reader, I’m not aware of the limitations. I have much respect for the NLA, but I do have questions regarding the number of samples for each lake. Furthermore, a statement or two discussing the need to validate modeled data may be worthwhile. Is there a way to see if the probabilities actually align with the accuracy and type II error rates predicted by the conditional probability approach?
 
Abstract-Specific Comments: Near the bottom of the abstract, the units seem quite high for microcystins (g/L) rather than micrograms/L. The micro Greek symbol (mu) may have been lost during uploading.
 
Results Comments: (1) In discussing the lake exceedances of the various recommended levels by EPA, the addition of ‘drinking water’ is appropriate in my opinion. Although it is mentioned earlier in the methods, further providing the information in the results is helpful to a novice reader or a person just becoming familiar with drinking water regulations and guidelines, as the U.S. EPA child level may be presumed by a reader to be a level for recreation in a lake rather than a level associated with finished drinking water after water treatment. (2) “All lakes had reported chl a concentrations that exceeded detection limits” Does this mean that some were over range? Or  does this mean that “All lakes had detectable levels of chl a”
 
Discussion Comments: The wedge pattern in figure 2 is not apparent in figure 2, however, the logic makes sense and is supported visually by the conditional probability plots in fig 1. If figure 2 could have two lines of best fit (similar to the way some researchers do for funnel plots on publication bias papers), it may be easier to see the wedge shape.
